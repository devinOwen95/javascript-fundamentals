//Assignment Operator
    // = is one
let r = 5;

//adition assignment operator
r=r+1 //a way to add 1 to r, another way to do it
r += 1; // r is equal to what it was before plus 1, but a quicker way to do it because its only 1 is
r++; //but dont use in string
r-=7; 
r--;


//multiplication assignment operator
r*=10; means r *10

//division assignment operator
r /= 3;

//exponent assginment operator
r **= 3; //raises r to third power

//modulus assignment operator divides and ignores remainder
r %= 5;
