/*


Variables


there are let(best to use)
var(same but older and more flexible)
const(cannot change/will not change)

let a = 2   a is variable  2 is value

*/

console.log(a);


 let         b              =              123;           //space doesnt matter
//1          2              3               4
/* 
1- javascript keyword
2- name you give the variable
3- assignment operator
4- value of variable

1 and 2 are declaration
3 and 4 are initionalization 

*/
numberone = 'riker'; //if you forget var/let js may still let it work
console.log(numberone);

var currentAge = 26; //can change, should always use let though

const dob = '01/01/1950'; //constant doesnt change

//dob = "abc123"; cant do this because its constant, cant reassign constant, will show in code line where error is wrong in error message
/* how to change currentAge varriable
        let currentage = 88; wouldnt work bc let is supposed to declare something that never existed, currentAge already been declared



*/

currentAge = 88;  //this tells program to look for currentAge to change it and ignore other, 
var currentAge = 88 // could also do this, these both are same thing
console.log(currentAge);
